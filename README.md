# InMemoryDB
Database that handles transactions
Instructions for Running Code:
  1. Open the project in CLion
  2. With the InMemoryDB labeled inmemoryDB in main, run commands on it to test.
  3. Can use get, put, begin_transaction, commit, and rollback commands
  4. Will throw errors for when transactions are already in progress or not in progress, will return -1 for null.
Modifications to Assignment
In order for this assignment to become for “official,” I think clearer testing qualifications and test cases need to be qualified. Instead of just grading on “working code,” the code should be tested based on specific criteria or mystery tests that are stated. Additionally, instructions can be more detailed for each method, instead of just providing a couple examples of return values. And perhaps the project could be made a bit more difficult by adding more methods such as adding or subtracting to values, establishing different accounts, etc.
